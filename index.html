            <li>
              <b>Increased Information Quality</b></br>
              Digital whistleblowing provides an unprecedented opportunity to qualify information being reported with questionnaires presented to whistleblowers guiding them through a detailed set of questions that catch structured data instead of the usual long written stories.</br>
              Having well structured questionnaires reduces noise and false claims; increases the actionability of whistleblower submission; improves the efficiency of the whistleblowing reporting procedure and this is where most of the effort of OpenWhistleblowing goes.

              <b>Powerful Questionnaire Builder</b></br>
              Questionnaires can be created and modified at any time through a simple graphic interface, without any technical skills, enabling the analyst to fine tune it over time;</br>
              Questions can be configured as mandatory or not; each of them can have a description, help hints and can be grouped with other questions to form a compound question;</br>
              Questions can be aligned horizontally or vertically and could be made of many different information types (select-box, check-box, text-box, etc);</br>
              All text area can be have a minimum and maximum amount of characters to let the whistleblower focus on providing a simple summary and extended descriptions and giving analysts the opportunity to quickly look at submissions;</br>
              Custom specialized information elements are being added with every new release, to improve the analysis capabilities and cross-correlation of data.

              <b>Rich Questionnaires Database</b></br>
              OpenWhistleblowing provides by default multiple ready-made questionnaires proven to be well tested by our end-users and specifically design for certain use cases, such as anti-corruption.

              <b>Customable Case Query</b></br>
              OpenWhistleblowing enable the configuration of custom view of cases with dynamic sorting and query of all data to facilitate operations of analysis and prioritization of handling.</br>
              Every question could become selectors in the case view with its own columns, operating as a selector for data query and visualization.

              <b>Whistleblower Identity</b></br>
              whistleblowers are always given the ability to declare their identity at submission time or stay anonymous with the options to disclose it at a later stage when a his case starts being handled, following a bi-directional chat communication.</br>
              The identity inquiry can be fine tuned to suit most use cases;</br>
              - It can be enabled/disabled;</br>
              - The question "do you want to tell us who you are?" can be default checked as yes or no, to provide opt-in/opt-out options;</br>
              - Warning dialogs while switching between opt-in to opt-out or vice-versa can be customized).

              <b>Bi-Directional Anonymous Communication</b></br>
              In the non-digital Whistleblowing world, anonymous reporting used to be uni-directional form of communication with letter drop-off, without ability to communicate with the anonymous whistleblower.</br>
With OpenWhistleblowing it is possible to keep a bi-directional communication channel with an integrated chat system, even when the Whistleblower decided to stay anonymous, giving the analyst the possibility to establish a relationship and understand the reported case.</br>
Usually anonymous whistleblowers decide to disclose their identity once they can trust that the sent material report is being taken care, establishing a relationship with analysts through the anonymous chat system. That is often a useful step to provide whistleblowers the legal protection they deserve by law in specific countries.

              <b>Segregation of Whistleblower Identity</b></br>
              To further strengthen the whistleblower identity protection, OpenWhistleblowing provides the ability to safeguard the access to the identity information by enforcing an authorization procedure.</br>
              Whenever the feature is enabled and whistleblower provides their identity, all the identity information are not directly accessible by the analysts together inside the case, but a motivated authorization request must be requested to a custodian user.</br />
              The custodian of identities, while not being able to see the identity data, can authorize or deny requests by receivers to access the identity of a specific report to a specific analyst; in case the request is denied the custodian should mandatory fill a motivation.</br>
              This organizational security process ensure that the whistleblowers identity information is disclosed only if strictly needed and when valid motivated requests are provided.

              The confidentiality of reports by Whistleblowers can be extremely relevant, so OpenWhistleblowing make it sure that all sensible data stored in the database are properly encrypted and made it available only to authorized users.
              The encryption and decryption of data happens directly into the web browser of the users, so that data never touch the servers in a readable/accessible format.  That way not even the IT department, that could be subject to a conflict of interest in the Whistleblowing procedures, could know what's going on.</br>

              The IP Address, usually representing the location of the whistleblower computer on the internet or in the corporate intranet, is never acquired or disclosed, guaranteeing the impossibility of traceback.</br>
              That is implemented thanks to a special anonymizing proxy called Tor2web, already used nowadays on the internet as the de-facto anonymous publishing system for Tor Hidden Services.
